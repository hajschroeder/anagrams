## Description

This is an independent project for the coding bootcamp Epicodus. The intent is to prove the author's knowledge of basic Ruby coding and RSpec testing by means of writing and Anagram/Antigram checker. For the purpose of this exercise, an anagram is defined as a word or phrase that share all the same letters as another word or phrase ("calm" and "clam", eg) and an antigram is defined as a word or phrase that share zero letters as another("cat" and "dog" eg). 

## Setup/Installation
_Note, this will require your local device to have Ruby installed_
* Clone this repository to your desktop
* Open the folder saved to your desktop with VSCode (or any other IDE capable of running Ruby scripts)
* Open a new terminal and from the root directory of the project type './anagram_script.rb'

## Known Bugs
While the program is currently working with all tests passing in it's present state, it is far from a finished product. Of the five functionality objectives assigned, only three are present. The author ran into a problem with his working environment, which took the better part of two days to fix (including uninstall/reinstalling Ruby and it's associated applications and gems etc.). Naturally, this served as an effective impediment in meeting all objectives by the initial deadline. That being said, work will nevertheless continue until all functionality and scripting is achieved.
